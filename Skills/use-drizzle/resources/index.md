In this first iteration, almost all query-building features have been copied from the PostgreSQL dialect since Gel is fully PostgreSQL-compatible. The only change in this iteration is the data types. The Gel dialect has a different set of available data types, and all mappings for these types have been designed to avoid any extra conversions on Drizzle's side. This means you will insert and select exactly the same data as supported by the Gel protocol.
