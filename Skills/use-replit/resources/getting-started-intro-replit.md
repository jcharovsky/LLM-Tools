Getting Started

Introduction

Replit is an AI-powered platform that lets you create and publish apps from a single browser tab. Instead of wrestling with complex development environments, you get coding, publishing, and collaboration tools in one integrated interface.

![Replit Workspace](https://mintcdn.com/replit/rBzGsKp9NcWJ7sib/images/getting-started/workspace.jpg?fit=max&auto=format&n=rBzGsKp9NcWJ7sib&q=85&s=d254d021e7ba96a358f070a4700031bd)

Building apps traditionally requires installing programs, languages, and packages—a time-consuming setup process. On Replit, the platform configures your environment instantly, so you can start building whether you’re a beginner or experienced developer. You have everything required to create apps from one browser tab—no installation required. With AI coding tools, real-time collaboration, and instant sharing, Replit gets you from idea to app, fast.
