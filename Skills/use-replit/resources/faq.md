Why is my Replit App failing to load?

If your Replit App is failing to load, try these debugging steps:

  1. Test your [internet connection](https://www.speedtest.net/).
  2. Try a different browser.
  3. Check if your browser has enabled JavaScript.
  4. Use the command `kill 1` in the shell to kill and restart the virtual Linux machine backing your Replit App.

How can I upload a large file to my Replit App?

If the file is too large for a standard GUI upload, you can use `scp` (Secure Copy) to securely transfer files between local and remote systems over [SSH](/replit-workspace/ssh). To copy files from your local machine to the remote machine, use this syntax:`scp filename username@ip_address:/home/username`You can also copy entire directories using scp.
