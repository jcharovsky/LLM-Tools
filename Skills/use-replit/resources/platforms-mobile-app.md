Replit Mobile App

The [Replit mobile app](https://replit.com/mobile) is a full-featured App creation environment where you can build and publish apps with a mobile experience optimized for phone and tablet.

![image of the mobile app](https://mintcdn.com/replit/kUsNtSHFZJZXt9Gk/images/mobile/mobile-screens.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=kUsNtSHFZJZXt9Gk&q=85&s=48a723ab3b9fb1747a38dc165424abe3)

## 

​

Getting started

Follow these steps to learn to install the app and create a Replit App.

### 

​

Install the app

To install the app on your compatible mobile device, follow these steps:

  1. Navigate to the [mobile app download page](https://replit.com/mobile) and install the app for your mobile device OS.

Build with Agent

  1. Open the **Create** tab
  2. Describe what you want to build
  3. Tap **Start chat**

Agent starts building your app right away.

Start from a template or GitHub
