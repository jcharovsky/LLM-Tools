Quickstarts

Create with AI

## 

​

Create your app using AI

⏰ _Estimated time: 7 minutes_ Learn how to create your Replit App using the **Agent** and **Assistant** AI tools in this guide.

## Agent

Specializes in generating new projects and building complex features.

## Assistant

Specializes in describing your code, making quick fixes, and adding new features.

Follow the steps below to build a polished business website. Use Replit’s AI features to create an app, and refine it until it matches your desired design.

![image of the Completed App](https://mintcdn.com/replit/h9U_mFqw8XzNXJwv/images/getting-started/quickstart_ai_complete.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=h9U_mFqw8XzNXJwv&q=85&s=c9f8c70074726fcaa44932037d722af6)

1

Create an App

Navigate to the Home screen and select **Create App** :![image of the Create App button](https://mintcdn.com/replit/0UCOQvZyQpUEM03B/images/shared/buttons/create_app.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=0UCOQvZyQpUEM03B&q=85&s=705d40879ca0ed04e8cc315c1e34649d)Select the **Create with Replit Agent** tab as shown in the following image:

![image of the Create with Replit Agent tab](https://mintcdn.com/replit/h9U_mFqw8XzNXJwv/images/getting-started/quickstart_ai_agent_tab.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=h9U_mFqw8XzNXJwv&q=85&s=2a090cd16e6106b66d7d1d99cff7c2e5)

2

Craft your prompt

To ask Agent to create your Replit App, enter your **prompt** in the text area. A prompt is a description of the task you want AI to perform.You can include text and file attachments in your prompt. Follow these steps to submit both in your prompt:

  1. Copy the following image:

![image of a SaaS business website](https://mintcdn.com/replit/rBzGsKp9NcWJ7sib/images/getting-started/saas_website.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=rBzGsKp9NcWJ7sib&q=85&s=2067b8c5135a6721522ae743de44000c)

  2. Paste the image into Agent text area.
  3. Enter the following prompt in the text area:

Copy

Ask AI
         
         Build a website for a SaaS B2B website that looks like the attached file.

  4. Select **Start building**.



3

Review and approve Agent's plan

After you submit your prompt, Agent sets up your Replit App and provides updates on its status in real time. You can monitor and view the history in the **Progress** tab.When Agent finishes setup, it prompts you with what it intends to build and options to include additional features as shown in the following image:

![image of Agent's approve dialog](https://mintcdn.com/replit/h9U_mFqw8XzNXJwv/images/getting-started/quickstart_ai_agent_approve.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=h9U_mFqw8XzNXJwv&q=85&s=e0e12411ed9022c097f53675f38cf08b)

Leave the additional options unchecked and select **Approve plan & start**.

4

Test the app

After Agent builds your app, navigate to the **Preview** tab, where you can interact with the website. The website should resemble the following image:

The generated website might differ since Agent can return different results for the same prompt.

![image of the Preview tool showing the website created by Agent](https://mintcdn.com/replit/h9U_mFqw8XzNXJwv/images/getting-started/quickstart_ai_agent_generated_page.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=h9U_mFqw8XzNXJwv&q=85&s=a43537d5d2f2fd7de129ad7d89832bd6)

Since the prompt only includes information about the landing page, Agent might omit content creation for the links on the page.The next step demonstrates how to use Assistant to add those pages.

5

Improve the app using the Assistant

Navigate to the **Assistant** tab, which should resemble the following image:

![image of the Assistant tab](https://mintcdn.com/replit/h9U_mFqw8XzNXJwv/images/getting-started/quickstart_ai_assistant_new.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=h9U_mFqw8XzNXJwv&q=85&s=1cff00bfb352263664b4a2ecf5a5c8bb)

Enter the following prompt in the text area and submit it:

Copy

Ask AI
    
    
    Create pages for each of the links in the navigation bar.

You can select **Preview code changes** to view the Assistant’s planned changes.Select **Apply All** and confirm your selection if prompted.

Assistant and Agent, which rely on popular AI models, occasionally produce results that don’t fulfill your request. If you encounter issues, follow up with a prompt that describes the error messages or the incorrect behavior. Alternatively, you can use the Rollback feature to restore your Replit App to a previously known working state.

At this point, you should have a navigable website that includes sample text and functional links.

Try the tasks in the following sections to build your knowledge of Replit.

### 

​

Undo an Agent change

Agent lets you perform a rollback, a feature that reverts your app to a previous checkpoint, discarding all changes made after that point. Follow these steps to revert the app to a specific checkpoint:

When you use the rollback feature, you restore the Replit App to a previous state. This action removes all changes made after that point. This includes edits by you or AI-powered features and AI conversation context. Database data can also be restored if you select “Restore databases” under “Additional rollback options.” The rollback affects your entire development environment.

For detailed information about checkpoints and rollbacks, see [Checkpoints and Rollbacks](/replitai/checkpoints-and-rollbacks).

1

Locate the checkpoint

Navigate to the **Agent** tab and locate the checkpoint you want to restore.Select **Rollback to here** to undo all changes after that point as shown in the following image:

2

Verify the rollback

After Agent completes your request, check that the **Agent** tab displays “Rollback completed”.Confirm that your app functionality matches its state before the checkpoint.

###

Undo an Assistant change

Assistant lets you perform a rollback, a feature that reverts your app to a previous checkpoint, discarding all changes made after that point. Follow these steps to revert the app to a specific checkpoint:

When you use the rollback feature, you restore the Replit App to a previous state. This action removes all changes made after that point. This includes edits by you or AI-powered features and AI conversation context. Database data can also be restored if you select “Restore databases” under “Additional rollback options.” The rollback affects your entire development environment.
