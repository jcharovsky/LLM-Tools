Replit AI

Replit AI

Replit AI transforms how you build software with Agent, our AI-powered development assistant. Agent allows you to build entire applications in minutes, without knowing how to code.

**New with Agent 3** \- Extended autonomous builds with minimal supervision, App Testing for self-validation, two ways to start an app (design-first vs. full app first), and Agents & Automations for building your own autonomous systems.

## 

​

What you can build

With Agent, you can:

  * **Transform ideas into apps:** Describe your vision in plain language and watch Agent build a complete application
  * **Accelerate development:** Get instant code explanations, intelligent autocomplete, and contextual help
  * **Debug efficiently:** Identify and fix issues with AI-powered analysis and suggestions
  * **Learn as you build:** Receive detailed explanations and best practice recommendations

Learn more about Agent in the following video:

## 

​

Getting started

The fastest way to experience Replit AI is to create your first app with Agent:

  1. **Start with Agent** : Follow the [Create with AI](/getting-started/quickstarts/ask-ai) quickstart to build an app from scratch
  2. **Choose how to start** : Try “Design & Iterate” for rapid prototyping or “Build Full App” to get a functional MVP on the first run
  3. **Experience Agent 3’s autonomy** : Customize Agent’s **[Autonomy Level](/replitai/autonomy-level)** while it tests itself with **App Testing**
  4. **Set up billing** : Configure [usage alerts and budgets](/billing/managing-spend) to control your AI spending



Agent and Advanced Assistant are premium features that charge your Replit account based on usage. For pricing information and billing policies, see [Replit AI Billing](/billing/ai-billing).

### 

​

Accessing Agent

You can access Agent from any Replit App:

  * **Tools dock** : Find Agent in the left sidebar of your Workspace
  * **Create new app** : Start with Agent directly from the “Create a new App” screen



Agent is now available on all projects. Use [General Agent](/replitai/general-agent) to work with any framework or project type, including existing apps and Developer Framework templates.

### 

​

Key capabilities

Agent offers powerful features that revolutionize your development workflow: **Complete app generation**

  * Natural language descriptions become functional applications
  * Intelligent architecture decisions and best practices
  * Automatic environment setup and dependency management
  * Seamless integration of databases, file storage, and third-party services

**Interactive development**

  * Chat-based interface for complex requests
  * File attachments and web content integration
  * Rollback capabilities for safe experimentation
  * Real-time progress tracking and feedback

**Autonomous development (New in Agent 3)**

  * **App Testing** : Automated computer use testing for the Agent to spin up a browser and test its own work, just like a real user
  * **Autonomy Level** : Customize how independently Agent works and reviews code, from hands-on control to extended autonomous development
  * **Agents & Automations**: for building your own autonomous systems



## 

​

Use cases

### 

​

Build a complete app with Agent

Describe your app idea in natural language and let Agent handle the implementation:

### 

​

Add complex integrations

Integrate payment processing, APIs, or advanced features using natural language:

## 

​

Pricing and billing

Agent uses transparent, effort-based pricing designed to provide value at every level: **Agent** : Effort-based pricing that charges based on the complexity and scope of your requests

  * Simple changes cost less than complex builds
  * One meaningful checkpoint per request
  * Extended autonomous builds with less supervision and self-testing capabilities
  * Advanced capabilities like Dynamic Intelligence (Extended Thinking and High Power)
  * Agent 3 features: App Testing, build modes, and Agents & Automations
