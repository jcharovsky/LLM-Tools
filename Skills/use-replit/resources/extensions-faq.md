Extensions

Frequently Asked Questions

How does my extension get verified?

A Replit staff member must review your Extension and manually verify it.

My backend server isn't working with my extension

Extensions are expected to be a bundle that can be [statically served](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/static-vs-dynamic-website). This means that you can’t run a server in the same Replit App as the extension you’re hosting. We would recommend separating your server and client for extension development.

My extension is throwing a timeout error

Make sure you are viewing your extension through the correct pane and not the [Preview](/replit-workspace/workspace-features/preview) pane. To correctly open your extension, use the [Extension Devtools](/extensions/development/devtools). If your extension is opened in the correct pane, hit the Reload icon in the extension tab.

What's the difference between the Preview tool and an Extension?

The preview tool uses a normal iframe to displays the web output of your Replit App. In the case of an extension, a special handshake is established between that web output and the Replit workspace.
