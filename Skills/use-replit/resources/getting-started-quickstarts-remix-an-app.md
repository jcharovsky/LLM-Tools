## 

​

Create your Remix

⏰ _Estimated time: 1 minute_ Follow the steps in this guide to create a Remix of the following solar system visualization:

![image of the Remix button on the Replit App page](https://mintcdn.com/replit/h9U_mFqw8XzNXJwv/images/getting-started/quickstart_remix_app_preview.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=h9U_mFqw8XzNXJwv&q=85&s=2b22cccdd1616aeec84b9ba52b0656a2)

Try the published app at [Solar System Visualization Demo Replit App](https://solar-system-viz.replit.app/).

1

Remix the app

Open the [Solar System Visualization](https://replit.com/@matt/Solar-System-Visualization?v=1) Replit App in your browser and select **Remix Template** :![image of the Remix button on the Replit App page](https://mintcdn.com/replit/0UCOQvZyQpUEM03B/images/shared/buttons/remix_button.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=0UCOQvZyQpUEM03B&q=85&s=8a951b014e4eea31767bbf22c18d7ec2)

2

​

Explore

Try the tasks in the following sections to learn how **Agent** and **Assistant** , Replit’s AI-powered tools can help you build your app. Agent specializes in building projects from scratch and making complex changes to a Replit App. Assistant specializes in smaller changes and describing the app’s code.

Assistant and Agent, which rely on popular AI models, occasionally produce results that don’t fulfill your request. If you encounter issues, follow up with a prompt that describes the error messages or the incorrect behavior. Alternatively, you can use the Rollback feature to restore your Replit App to a previously known working state.

The following sections show examples of using them to enhance this Remix.

### 

​

Add a feature using Agent

Agent is now available on all projects, including Remixes. Use [General Agent](/replitai/general-agent) to work with any framework or project type.

Follow these steps to add a complex feature to your Remix using Agent:

1

Craft a prompt

Navigate to the **Agent** tab.Enter the following prompt in the text area:

Copy

Ask AI
    
    
    Add a button that toggles an autopilot flyby mode.
    

After you submit the prompt, Agent might pause and ask for clarification or confirmation. Respond in the text area.

2

Test the feature

Navigate to the **Preview** tab to see Agent’s updates to the visualization.Try toggling the added autopilot button.Since the initial prompt excluded information such as speed and position of the flyby, the result might not match your expectations.

3

Refine the feature

If the feature differs from your expectations, continue the conversation by entering the following prompt in the **Agent** text area:

Copy

Ask AI
    
    
    Change the autopilot to slowly and continuously fly between planets.
    

After Agent completes the feature, the **Preview** might resemble the following image:

![image of the Remix button on the Replit App page](https://mintcdn.com/replit/h9U_mFqw8XzNXJwv/images/getting-started/quickstart_remix_app_preview.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=h9U_mFqw8XzNXJwv&q=85&s=2b22cccdd1616aeec84b9ba52b0656a2)

To undo these changes, select **Rollback to here** in the Checkpoint created immediately after starting the plan for the change in the **Agent** tab.Learn more about [Checkpoints and Rollbacks](/replitai/checkpoints-and-rollbacks).

### 

​

Add a feature using Assistant

Follow these steps to add a quick enhancement to your Remix using Assistant:

1

Craft a prompt

Navigate to the **Assistant** tab and enter the following prompt:

Copy

Ask AI
    
    
    Add a button that changes the planet orbit speeds to 0.5x, 1x, and 2x.
    

After you submit the prompt, Assistant describes the changes it wants to make and lets you review the code changes before proceeding. Select **Preview code changes** to view a comparison of the current code and the updates.

2

Test the feature

Select **Apply all** and approve any following confirmations to continue.Navigate to the **Preview** tab to check the result.After Assistant completes the feature, the **Preview** might resemble the following image:

![image of the solar system visualization with speed controls](https://mintcdn.com/replit/h9U_mFqw8XzNXJwv/images/getting-started/quickstart_remix_assistant_result.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=h9U_mFqw8XzNXJwv&q=85&s=54d2f6e5a2bd9d654898245a6ee9ba4a)

To undo these changes, select **Undo these changes** in the **Assistant** tab.

## 

​

Continue your journey

Now that you’ve completed this tutorial, you’re ready to explore more possibilities with your Replit App. Try the following next steps to enhance your skills:

  * Ask Agent to implement a new complex feature or to check the code for bugs.
  * Ask Assistant to explain how the code works or to generate user instructions.
  * View and edit the Replit App source code and configuration in the **Files** tab.
  * Share your Replit App for others to remix. To learn more, see [Make your Replit App Public](/replit-app/collaborate#make-your-replit-app-public).
