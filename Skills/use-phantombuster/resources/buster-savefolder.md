**Saves a`folder` from your agent's disk to your persistent storage.**

## 

â€” path `(String)`

Path of the `folder` to save (optional, defaults to `.`).

  * `.` (everything from your current working directory)
  * `any/sub/../sub/directory`



Each file has it [MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type) guessed from its extension (if this fails, no MIME type is set).

## 

â€” saveAs `(String)`

Where to put the `folder` on your persistent storage (_optional_).  
By default, the folder will be saved at the root of your agent's folder in your persistent storage.  
If files with the same name already exist, they are overwritten.

  * `/` or empty string (root of your agent's folder in your persistent storage)
  * `any/sub/directory`
  * `dir/foo.txt` (this will create a directory named `foo.txt`, obviously not recommended)



_You do not need to create any intermediate directory (a/b/c/d will work)._

## 

â€” callback `(Function(err, url))`

Function called when finished (_optional_).

  * **`err (String)`** : `null` or a description of what went wrong if something went wrong (typically if there was a network error or timeout).
  * **`url (String)`** : the full `URL` to the folder on your persistent storage.

> If you take many screenshots or save many text files with nick rather than calling buster.save() for each file, just do a buster.saveFolder() at the end of your script.
