**Saves a distant or local`file` to your persistent storage.**

## 

â€” urlOrPath `(String)`

URL or path of the file to be saved.

  * `https://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo11w.png` (from the web)
  * `foo/my_screenshot.jpg` (from your agent's disk)
  * `http://soundcloud.com/` (you'll get the HTML content of their homepage)



When saving a distant file, the MIME type is taken from the Content-Type HTTP header (if present).  
When saving a local file, the MIME type is guessed from the file extension (if this fails, no MIME type is set).

## 

â€” saveAs `(String)`

Where to put the `file` on your persistent storage (_optional_).  
By default, the name will be taken from `urlOrPath` and the file will be saved at the root of your agent's folder in your persistent storage.  
If a file with the same name already exists, it is overwritten.

  * `foo/ (saves http://example.com/baz/bar.png as foo/bar.png)`
  * `null (saves http://example.com/foo/bar.png as bar.png)`
  * `foo/ (fails on http://example.com/ with could not determine filename)`
  * `foo/a (saves http://example.com/bar.png as foo/a)`



_You do not need to create any intermediate directory (a/b/c/d/e.jpg will work)._

## 

â€” headers `(Plain Object)`

HTTP headers to use when requesting the file (_optional_).  
Cookies are automatically set when using CasperJS or PhantomJS.

## 

â€” callback `(Function(err, url))`

Function called when finished (_optional_).

  * **`err (String)`** : `null` or a description of what went wrong if something went wrong (typically if there was a network error or timeout).
  * **`url (String)`** : the full `URL` to the file on your persistent storage.
