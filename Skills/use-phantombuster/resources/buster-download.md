**Source URL:** https://hub.phantombuster.com/reference/buster-download

**Downloads a distant file to your agent's disk (not to your persistent storage).**

If you do not save the file to your persistent storage (see [buster.save()](/reference/buster-save) or [buster.saveFolder()](/reference/buster-savefolder)), **it will be lost when your agent exits**.

## 

â€” url `(String)`

URL of the file to be downloaded.

  * `https://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo11w.png`
  * `http://soundcloud.com/` (you'll get the HTML content of their homepage)



## 

â€” saveAs `(String)`

Where to put the file on your agent's disk (_optional_).  
By default, the name will be taken from url and the file will be saved in the current working directory on your agent's disk.  
If a file with the same name already exists, it is overwritten.

  * `foo/ (saves http://example.com/baz/bar.png as foo/bar.png)`
  * `null (saves http://example.com/foo/bar.png as bar.png)`
  * `foo/ (fails on http://example.com/ with could not determine filename)`
  * `foo/a (saves http://example.com/bar.png as foo/a)`



**Intermediate directories are not created automatically on your agent's disk.** When using NodeJS, create directories beforehand with [require('fs').mkdirSync()](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_mkdirsync_path_mode).

## 

â€” headers `(Plain Object)`

HTTP headers to use when requesting the file (_optional_).  
Cookies are automatically set when using CasperJS or PhantomJS.

## 

â€” callback `(Function(err, path))`

Function called when finished (_optional_).

  * **`err (String)`** : `null` or a description of what went wrong if something went wrong (typically if there was a network error or timeout).
  * **`path (String)`** : the path to the file on your agent's disk.

> When running NodeJS within Phantombuster (the recommended binary), you also have access to common HTTP request modules such as `request`, `needle` and `fetch`. They can come in handy! See [packages & modules](/docs/packages).
