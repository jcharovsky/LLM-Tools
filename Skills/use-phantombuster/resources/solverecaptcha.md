**Solves a Google noCAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA.**

This method sends the required tokens to one of our partners so that a human can solve a Google noCAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA challenge.

`buster.solveNoCaptcha()` calls will take about 30 to 60+ seconds to return a response token. It mainly depends on the availability of human workers in the queue and their ability to quickly solve the challenges from Google.

When a result token is returned, 2 is substracted from your daily CAPTCHA counter. Contrary to standard image CAPTCHA solving methods, when returned, this token is always valid.

## 

â€” siteUrl `(String)`

URL of the page or website where the noCAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA widget is found.  
When using NickJS, simply use the return value from `tab.getUrl()`.

## 

â€” captchaToken `(String)`

Token of the noCAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA widget. This token is generally found in the `data-sitekey` attribute of the `<div class="g-recaptcha">` element. However, some site administrators use the widget differently and you might have to find this token somewhere else, for example in the `&k=<TOKEN>` parameter of the URL of the widget's `<iframe>`.

## 

â€” secret `(String)`

Second token from the noCAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA widget (_optional_).  
Almost all websites do not use this token anymore, it is only for deprecated noCAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA versions. If present, it's generally found in the `data-stoken` attribute of the widget's `<div>`.

## 

â€” callback `(Function(err, result))`

Function called when finished (_optional_).

  * **`err (String)`** : `null` or a description of what went wrong if something went wrong.
  * **`result (String)`** : the response token, put this as a value in the `<textarea id="g-recaptcha-response">` element and submit the form.

> Custom noCAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA installations
> 
> Not all websites use this CAPTCHA system the same way. The widget supports custom JavaScript integration, as you can see in its [official documentation](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/display). If that's the case on your target website (not common), you'll first have to understand how the widget is integrated to get its token and to submit the result.

> ## ðŸ“˜
> 
> Also supports "invisible" noCAPTCHA!
> 
> The new "invisible" noCAPTCHA is basically the same widget but hidden in the page and automatically activated. Check its [official documentation](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/invisible) to understand how your target website might integrate it.
