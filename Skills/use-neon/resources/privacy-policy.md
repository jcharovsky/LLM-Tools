We collect Personal Data when you sign up for a Neon Account, create or modify user information, set preferences, or provide any other related information to access or utilize the Service.

We collect payment and billing information when you register for paid Services. For example, we may ask you to provide a billing address or a billing contact for your Neon Account. If you give us payment information, we use it solely as authorized by you in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

You may also provide payment information, such as a credit card number or bank account number, when purchasing products or services. We use secure third-party payment service providers to manage payment processing, which is collected through a secure payment process. 

#### Customer Testimonials 

We post customer testimonials and comments on our Website, which may contain Personal Data. We obtain each Customer’s consent via email or through other agreements between Customers and Neon prior to posting the Customer’s name and testimonial.

The Customer Personal Data includes Personal Data that the Customer and/or any Authorized User Transfers through the Platform in connection with its use of the Services.

We want to make it clear that we do not control any Customer Data that is uploaded and stored on the Platform. 

We store Customer Data on our service provider’s servers, the region determined by our Customers. We process Customer Data as a processor under our Customer’s instructions and in compliance with the applicable Agreement. 

Our Customers control and are responsible for correcting, deleting, or updating any Customer Data that they Transfer to the Platform and are also responsible for complying with any regulations or laws that require providing notice, disclosure, and/or obtaining consent prior to transferring the Personal Data to Neon for processing purposes.

Our Agreement prohibits the transfer or upload of Sensitive Information. You shall be solely liable for any and all liabilities arising from or relating to the transfer of Sensitive Information. 

### c. Information We Collect and Process When You Use the Platform

#### Information From Users With Accounts

If you create an Account, we require some basic information at the time of Account creation. To create an Account, you have the option to either provide your name, password, and a valid email address or create an Account by logging into a Hasura, Github, Google Account, or any other method listed on our sign-up page. You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, which may include “User Personal Information.”

“User Personal Information” is any information about a user that could, alone or together with other information, personally identify the user. Information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a profile picture or an avatar are examples of “User Personal Information.”

User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our Service.

We need your User Personal Information to create your Account and to provide the Service you use. We use your User Personal Information, specifically your user name and email address, to identify you. We use your email address to communicate with you as outlined in the email communication section below. We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy. 

#### Usage Data 

We may generate and use technical logs, data and learnings about your use of the Platform, and Customer Data in an aggregate, anonymized form (“Usage Data”). 

We engage third-party providers to collect Usage Data. For more information about how we protect your information with these service providers, please see the section “How We Share Personal Data”.

#### Third-Party Integrations 

You may connect third-party integrations to your Neon Account. These third-party integrations may ask for certain permissions to access Customer Data, Personal Data, or send information to your Neon Account. It is your responsibility to review any third-party integrations you authorize. We may collect information about what types of integrations you use in your Neon Account.

Any permission(s) granted by you grant(s) these third parties access to your Customer Data and your Personal Data, which may include (but is not limited to) granting third-party applications access to view, store, and modify your Customer Data, Personal Data, or any other data stored in your Neon Account. We are not responsible for the practices of third-party integrations, so please carefully review the permissions you grant to third-party applications.

We use common internet technologies, such as web server logs, to collect data about all visitors that access our Website. 

The information we collect about visitors to our Website includes the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We collect this information to better understand how visitors to our Website use Neon, and to monitor and protect the security of the Website.

### d. Information We Collect From Other Sources

#### Neon Partners 

We may receive information about you or other users of your Neon Account from our global network of partners. We may receive this data from our deal and lead registration process through our partners.

We may also collect information about you through our partner co-marketing partnerships. For example, you may sign up to a webinar or download a white paper published by Neon and a Neon co-marketing partner. 

**Market Places**

When you purchase Neon Products through a third-party marketplace, we obtain certain Personal Data with the marketplace provider to facilitate order processing, delivery, customer support, and to meet legal obligations. This data includes your name, contact information, payment details, and order history.

#### Third Parties 

We may receive information from third-party service providers, from related companies, and from our business and solution partners.

#### Personal Data from Different Sources

We may combine Personal Data we collect from you with personal information we receive from other sources, such as third-party providers of business information and publicly available sources (like social media platforms). This may include physical mail addresses, job titles, email addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, and social media profiles. This helps us to update and improve our records, identify new customers, create more personalized advertising, suggest products and services that may interest you, deliver personalized communications, and promote events. The collection of your personal information by these other third-party providers is governed by the provider’s privacy policy.

#### Buttons, tools from other companies

Our Website may include features and widgets (such as the share and/or “like” button or interactive mini-programs) that run on our Websites. These features may collect your IP address, which pages you visit on our sites.. These features and widgets are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our Websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these features. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy and other policies of the companies providing them.

## **2\. How We Use Personal Data**

#### To facilitate contractual and pre-contractual business relationships 

We use Personal Data to enter into business relationships with prospective customers and to perform the contractual obligations under the Agreements that we have with existing Customers. For example, we may collect your Personal Data to schedule calls and meetings for the Platform’s demo, prepare offers for you, set up and manage your Account on the Platform, or perform certain accounting, auditing, and billing activities.

#### To comply with our regulatory and other legal obligations

These regulatory and other legal obligations include Data Processing requirements of the GDPR and “Anti-Money Laundering” (AML) and “Know-Your-Customer” (KYC) obligations.

#### To Communicate with You About the Services

We use the Account information you provide to Neon when signing up for an Account to send you transactional emails about billing, account management, and other administrative matters. We may also send you updates regarding our Agreement or other legal agreements, and may also communicate with you about security incidents via email.

#### To Provide the Service and offer support 

We use your Account information, Personal Data, and Customer Data to provide the Services. For example, we use the email address you provide when signing up for the product to create your Account, and we use your payment information to process payments for paid use of the Platform or Products. We may also use this information to authenticate you when you log in and to provide customer support.

We use your information both Personal Data and Customer Data to provide customer support, such as resolving technical issues you encounter and analyzing product outages or bugs. You grant Neon the right to use your Personal Data and Customer Data solely as necessary to (a) maintain, improve, protect and update the Services and the Platform; (b) to prevent or address service, security, support, or technical issues related to the Services.

#### To Personalize the Platform for you by understanding your needs. 

We may use Usage Data to operate, improve, analyze and support the Platform and/or the Services, and for other lawful business purposes. Neon might use the Customer Data without de-identification, aggregation and anonymization only for troubleshooting and/or support purposes.

#### To Develop new Services and Improve existing Services

We also collect Usage Data to develop and improve our Services and create new services and products. For example, we use Usage Data to identify friction and bottlenecks in the user’s journey to optimize and improve the experience of our customers. We also use Usage Data to assess trends and usage across the Platform to help us determine what new features or integrations our users may be interested in. 

#### For Research and Analysis

We conduct aggregate analysis, market research and planning, develop business intelligence, generate statistical studies that enable us to operate, protect, make informed decisions, and report on the performance of our business.

#### To Secure and Protect our Platform and Users 

We use your Account information to investigate and help prevent security incidents. We may also use this information to meet legal requirements. We use your information to verify user Accounts and to detect and prevent abuse. 

We use log files to provide general statistics regarding use of our Website by you, including how you use our websites, what country you are logging in from (for analytics, export control, and regulatory purposes) and to help improve the navigation experience. Your IP addresses are also collected and logged for security purposes; for example, to track access patterns and investigate security events and incidents. For these purposes, we link this automatically-collected data to other personal data provided by you, for example your name, email address, address, and phone number. 

#### To Market and Promote the Services

We use the information you provide to Neon to market and promote the Services and other offerings. For example, we might use your email or physical address to send you information or content that we think may be of interest to you, by post, email, or other means. We may also send you marketing communications relating to our business.

You may opt out of receiving this promotional content by following the instructions contained in each communication that we send you or by contacting us at privacy@neon.tech. If you unsubscribe from our marketing lists, we will only continue to contact you regarding administrative matters and to respond to your requests.

We may also reach out to you via email or telephone to ask about other Neon Products or Services you may be interested in. If you have a call scheduled with a Neon representative, we may record and transcribe the call. You will be notified prior to the call that the call is being recorded, and you will be offered an opportunity to opt out of having the call recorded.

Where required by law, we will only send marketing communications with your consent. Otherwise, we will market and advertise our products and services on the basis of our legitimate business interests.

We receive information from third-party service providers and other sources such as third-party providers of business information and publicly available sources. We may receive and use information from these service providers and other sources in combination with other information we collect through other means described in this Privacy Policy for the purposes of providing you with updates and an improved service, like personalized communications, event promotion, and tailoring the websites or product to improve user experience. 

#### Other purposes if we obtain your consent

We share your data with third parties when you give us consent to do so.

### Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data (EEA and UK visitors only) 

Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect Personal Data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you.

If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data). Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

## **3\. How We Share Personal Data**

### a. Service Providers 

We may share Personal Data with our third-party service providers to support our Services. For example, we use service providers for data hosting, application development, marketing, sales support, and customer support. We may need to share your information with service providers to provide information about products or services to you. Examples may include removing repetitive information from prospect lists, analyzing data or performing statistical analysis on your use of the Platform or interactions on our websites, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, supplementing the information you provide us in order to provide you with better service, developing and improving the product and services, and providing customer service or support. These service providers are prohibited from using your Personal Data except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. In all cases where we share your information in this way, we explicitly require the third-party service providers to acknowledge and adhere to our privacy and data protection policies and standards.

### b. Partners 

We may share Personal Data with trusted Neon partners to provide our Services. We will also share Personal Data to contact you based on your request to receive such communications, help us perform statistical analysis, provide sales support, or provide customer support. Partners are required to maintain the confidentiality and security of your data.

We also partner with trusted third parties to provide you with co-marketing content that we think may be relevant to you. When you engage with these co-marketing partners, we will provide a link to the co-marketing partner’s privacy policy so you can learn more about how to opt out of the partner’s communications. 

### c. Corporate Events 

If we (or our assets) are acquired by another company, whether by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or otherwise, that company would receive all information gathered by Neon via providing the Services. In this event, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership, uses of your Personal Data, and choices you may have regarding your Personal Data.

### d. Public Forums

Our websites may offer publicly accessible message boards, blogs, and community forums. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose any information through our public message boards, blogs, or forums (including profile information associated with the Account you use to post the information) it may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites. Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your Account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you may disclose in this way. We will correct or delete any information you have posted on the websites if you so request, as described in Section “Your Privacy Rights and Choices” below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to and why.

### e. Compelled Disclosure 

We reserve the right to use or disclose your Personal Data if required by law or if we reasonably believe that use or disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or comply with a law, court order, or legal process. If you use the Platform, Customer Data is considered Confidential Information and you should review the Confidentiality terms in the Agreement for more information. 

### f. Market Place Providers

When you purchase Neon Products through a third-party market place, we provide Personal Data and usage data to the marketplace provider to facilitate order processing, delivery, customer support, and to meet legal obligations. This data includes your name, contact information, payment details, product usage and order history.

## **4\. How We Transfer Personal Data Internationally**

### a. International Transfers 

This Privacy Policy will apply even if we transfer Personal Data to other countries. We have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Data will remain protected wherever it is transferred. When we share Personal Data of individuals in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Switzerland or the United Kingdom (“UK”), we use the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (collectively, the “Data Privacy Framework”). We also implement the Standard Contractual Clauses (approved by the European Commission and Swiss authorities) and UK Addendum to the Standard Contractual Clauses (approved by the UK authorities) where required, as well as additional safeguards where appropriate (such as commercial industry-standard secure encryption methods to protect Customer data at rest and in transit, web application firewall protection, and other appropriate contractual and organizational measures). Please see our Data Privacy Framework statement below for more information.

**b. International transfers to third parties**

Some of the third parties described in this Privacy Policy, which provide services to us under contract, are based in other countries that may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the country in which you reside. When we share Personal Data of individuals in the EEA, Switzerland or UK with third parties, we use a variety of legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer, including the European Commission-approved Data Privacy Framework, the Standard Contractual Clauses, as well as additional safeguards where appropriate. For transfers to or from the United Kingdom, we make use of the UK Addendum. For transfers to or from Canada, we make use of the standard contractual clauses. With respect to personal data received from or transferred to Canada, Neon is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. Please contact us if you need more information about the legal mechanisms we rely on to transfer personal data outside the EEA, Switzerland, Canada, and UK.

### **c. Data Privacy Framework Notice**

Neon complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF”), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (collectively “the Data Privacy Framework”).

Neon has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-US DPF Principles with regard to the processing of Personal Data received from the European Union, and the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) and to the Swiss-US DPF Principles with regard to the processing of Personal Data received from Switzerland. If there is any conflict between this Privacy Policy and the DPF Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework and to view our certification, please visit <https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/>.

If you are located in the EU, UK, or Switzerland, you have the right to request access to the Personal Data that we hold about you and request that we correct, amend, or delete your Personal Data if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the DPF Principles. We will give you an opportunity to opt out where Personal Data we control about you is to be disclosed to an independent third party or used for a purpose that is materially different from those set out in this Privacy Policy. If you would like to exercise any of your rights, please contact us via the details provided below.

In compliance with the DPF Principles, Neon commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your Personal Data. We will investigate and attempt to resolve any DPF Principles-related complaints within 45 days. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of Personal Data received in reliance on the DPF Principles should first contact Neon via privacy@neon.tech. 

If you have unresolved DPF-related complaints that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact the:

EU DPA panel if you are based in the European Union. 

Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) if you are based in Switzerland. 

Information Commissioner’s Office if you are based in the United Kingdom.

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the DPF website, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Neon’s compliance with the DPF Principles.

In the context of an onward transfer, Neon is responsible for the processing of Personal Data it receives under the DPF Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. Neon shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if our agent processes your Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless Neon is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

Please note that under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

## 5\. How We Store and Secure Personal Data

### a. Data Storage and Security 

We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We secure the Personal Data you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. All Personal Data is protected using appropriate physical, technical, and organizational measures. For more on Security at Neon, please see <https://neon.tech/docs/security/security-overview>.

### b. Retention of Personal Data

How long we keep the information we collect about you depends on the type of information as well as how we collect and store that information.  
We retain Personal Data that you provide to us where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, as needed to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements).

> When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Data, we securely delete the information or anonymize it within 30 days. Should you wish your data to be deleted earlier you may also request the deletion of your data through the console, and such data will be deleted within 30 days. If deletion or anonymization is not possible, we will securely store your Personal Data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

If you have elected to receive marketing communications from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time, starting from the date you last expressed interest in our Customer Data, products, or services, for example as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Neon Account. 

Customer Data transferred to the Platform is retained according to the Agreement, Data Retention Policy, and any applicable Data Processing agreement.

  * Withdraw Consent. If we have collected and processed your Personal Data with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.

### d. Changes to this Privacy Policy 

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes in our Services, any applicable laws, or for other reasonable grounds. When changes are posted to this Policy, the “Last Updated” date at the top will be revised.

If there are material changes to how Neon will use your Personal Data, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you an email notification. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to remain informed of how Neon protects your information.

### e. Technical Preview

If you receive access to Neon Products or features, technologies, and services that are not yet generally available on a free or paid basis, including, but not limited to, any products, services, or features labeled as an alpha, beta, technical preview, or early access offering, or access and use Neon Products available in regions that are not generally available, including, but not limited to, any regions identified by Neon as “alpha”, “beta”, “preview”, “pre-release”, or “experimental” (the “Technical Preview Products”), please be aware that this Privacy Policy may not fully apply to these Technical Preview Products. Technical Preview Products are experimental and pre-release versions of our offerings, and as such, we may not be able to commit to following all aspects of this Privacy Policy during the beta testing phase. Technical Preview Products may undergo frequent changes and updates as we gather feedback and improve their functionality.

While we strive to protect your privacy to the best of our ability, please understand that:

  * **Limited Privacy Commitment:** During the testing and development of Technical Preview Products, our primary focus is on product improvement, functionality testing, and bug fixing. This may result in deviations from the usual data handling practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you have concerns about your privacy while using Beta Products, or if you wish to discontinue participation, please contact our support team or cease using the Beta Product.
  * **Data Collection:** We may collect usage and performance data related to Technical Preview Products to understand how they are being used and to address technical issues. This data may not be subject to the same privacy protections as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
  * **Notification:** We will make reasonable efforts to inform you of any specific privacy practices or changes that apply to Technical Preview Products but it is essential to exercise caution and discretion when using them.
  * **Feedback:** If you participate in a Technical Preview Product, we may request feedback and input from you. Your feedback can be valuable in shaping the final product, but it may involve sharing information that would not typically be collected under this Privacy Policy.



Once a Technical Preview Product transitions to a stable release, we will make every effort to ensure that it complies with our standard Privacy Policy. We appreciate your understanding and participation in helping us improve our products and services. Your privacy is important to us, even during the testing phase.
