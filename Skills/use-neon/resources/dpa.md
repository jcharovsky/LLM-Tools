  3. **CONFIDENTIALITY**
     1. **Personnel.** Neon shall ensure that any employees or personnel it authorizes to process Customer Personal Data is subject to an appropriate duty of confidentiality. 
  4. **SUBPROCESSING**
     1. **Authorization.** Customer provides a general authorization to Neon use of Subprocessors to process Customer Personal Data in accordance with this Section, including those Subprocessors listed at https://neon.com/subprocessors (“**Subprocessor List** ”).
     2. **Subprocessor Obligations.** Neon shall (i) enter into a written agreement with its Subprocessors, which includes data protection and security measures no less protective than the measures set forth in this DPA; and (ii) remain fully liable for any breach of the Agreement and this DPA that is caused by an act, error or omission of its Subprocessors to the extent that Neon would have been liable for such act, error or omission had it been caused by Neon. 
     3. **Subprocessor Changes.** At least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the date on which any new Subprocessor shall commence processing Customer Personal Data, Neon shall update the Subprocessor List and provide Customer with notice of that update. Such notice will be sent to individuals who have signed up to receive updates to the Subprocessor List via the mechanism(s) indicated on the Subprocessor List.
     4. **Subprocessor Objections.** Customer may object to Neon’ appointment of a new Subprocessor on reasonable grounds relating to data protection by notifying Neon in writing at privacy@neon.tech within ten (10) calendar days after receiving notice pursuant to Section 4.3. In such an event, Neon and Customer will discuss those objections in good faith with a view to achieving resolution**.** If the parties are not able to achieve resolution, within ten (10) calendar days from Neon’ written notification, Customer, as its sole and exclusive remedy, may terminate the Order Form(s) with respect to only those aspects which cannot be provided by Neon without the use of the new Subprocessor. Neon will provide Customer with a pro rata reimbursement of any prepaid, but unused fees of such Order Form(s) following the effective date of such termination. 
  5. **ASSISTANCE**
     1. **Data Subject Requests.** Customer is responsible for responding to and complying with data subject requests (“**DSR** ”). The Neon Services include controls that Customer may use to assist it to respond to DSR. If Customer is unable to access or delete any Customer Personal Data using such controls, Neon shall, taking into account the nature of the processing, reasonably cooperate with Customer to enable Customer to respond to the DSR. If a data subject sends a DSR to Neon directly and where Customer is identified or identifiable from the request, Neon will promptly forward such DSR to Customer**** and Neon shall not, unless legally compelled to do so, respond directly to the data subject except to refer them to the Customer to allow Customer to respond as appropriate. 
     2. **Data Protection Impact Assessments**. Neon will provide reasonably requested information regarding the Neon Services to Customer to carry out data protection impact assessments relating to the processing of Customer Personal Data and any related required consultation with supervisory authorities as required by Applicable Data Protection Laws, so long as Customer does not otherwise have access to the relevant information.
     3. **Legal Requests.** If Neon receives a subpoena, court order, warrant or other legal demand from law enforcement or any public or judicial authority seeking the disclosure of Customer Personal Data, Neon will attempt to redirect the governmental body to request such Customer Personal Data directly from Customer. As part of this effort, Neon may provide Customer’s basic contact information to the governmental body. If compelled to disclose Customer Personal Data to a governmental body, Neon will give Customer reasonable notice of the legal demand to allow Customer to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, unless Neon is legally prohibited from doing so.
  6. **SECURITY**
     1. **Security Measures.** Neon has implemented and will maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures as set forth in Annex C (“**Security Measures** ”). The Security Measures are subject to technical progress and development and Neon may update the Security Measures, provided that any updates shall not materially diminish the overall security of Customer Personal Data or the Neon Services. Neon may make available certain security controls within the Neon Services that Customer may use in accordance with the Documentation. 
     2. **Security Breach Notification.** In the event of a Security Breach, Neon will (a) notify Customer in writing without undue delay and**** in no event later than seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the Security Breach; and (b) promptly take reasonable steps to contain, investigate, and mitigate any adverse effects resulting from the Security Breach. Neon will reasonably cooperate with and assist Customer with respect to any required notification to supervisory authorities or data subjects (as applicable), taking into account the nature of the processing, the information available to Neon, and any restrictions on disclosing the information (such as confidentiality). 
  7. **AUDITS AND RECORDS**
     1. **Audit.** We will make information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA available to you and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections conducted by you or your auditor in order to assess compliance with this DPA, where required by applicable law. You acknowledge and agree that you will exercise your audit rights under this DPA by instructing us to comply with the audit measures described in this ‘Demonstration of Compliance’ section. You acknowledge that the Neon Services are hosted by our hosting Sub-Processors who maintain independently validated security programs and that our systems are audited annually as part of SOC 2 compliance and regularly tested by independent third party penetration testing firms. Upon request, we will supply (on a confidential basis) our SOC 2 report and summary copies of our penetration testing report(s) to you so that you can verify our compliance with this DPA**.******
  8. **TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA**
     1. **Restricted Transfers.** Where the transfer of Customer Personal Data to Neon is a Restricted Transfer, such transfer shall be governed by the Standard Contractual Clauses, which shall be deemed incorporated into and form an integral part of the Agreement in accordance with Annex B of this DPA.
     2. **Alternative Transfer Mechanisms**. If and to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction or a supervisory authority with binding authority orders (for whatever reason) that the measures described in this DPA cannot be relied on to lawfully transfer Customer Personal Data to Neon, the parties shall reasonably cooperate to agree and take any actions that may be reasonably required to implement any additional measures or alternative transfer mechanism to enable the lawful transfer of such Customer Personal Data. Additionally, in the event Neon adopts an alternative transfer mechanism (including any successor version of the Privacy Shield), such alternative transfer mechanism shall apply instead of the SCCs described in Section 8.1 of this DPA (but only to the extent such alternative transfer mechanism complies with applicable European Data Protection Laws and extends to the territories to which Customer Personal Data is transferred).
  9. **BACKUP, DELETION & RETURN **
     1. **No Backups.** The Neon Services do not include backup services or disaster recovery for Customer Personal Data. Neon does provide functionality within the Neon Services that may permit Customer to backup certain Customer Personal Data on its own. It is the Customer’s obligation to backup any Customer Personal Data if desired.
     2. **Deletion.** The Neon Services include controls that Customer may use at any time during the term of the Agreement to retrieve or delete Customer Personal Data. Subject to the terms of the Agreement, Neon will delete Customer Personal Data from the Neon Services when Customer uses such controls to send an instruction to delete.
     3. **Termination.** Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement and following Customer’s written request, Neon will delete or assist Customer in deleting any Customer Personal Data within its possession or control within thirty (30) days following such request. 
  10. **CCPA COMPLIANCE**
     1. Neon shall not process, retain, use, or disclose Customer Personal Data for any purpose other than for the purposes set out in the Agreement, DPA and as permitted under the CCPA. Neon shall not sell or share information as those terms are defined under the CCPA.
  11. **GENERAL**
     1. The parties agree that this DPA shall replace any existing data processing addendum, attachment, exhibit or standard contractual clauses that the parties may have previously entered into in connection with the Neon Services. Neon may update this DPA from time to time, with such updated version posted to https://neon.com/dpa or a successor website designated by Neon; provided, however, that no such update shall materially diminish the privacy or security of Customer Personal Data.
     2. If any part of this DPA is held unenforceable, the validity of all remaining parts will not be affected.
     3. Neon’ obligations set forth in this DPA shall also extend to Authorized Affiliates, subject to the following conditions: (a) Customer is solely responsible for communicating any additional processing instructions on behalf of its Authorized Affiliates; (b) Customer shall be responsible for Authorized Affiliates’ compliance with this DPA and all acts and/or omissions by an Authorized Affiliate with respect to Customer’s obligations under this DPA; and (c) if an Authorized Affiliate seeks to assert a legal demand, action, suit, claim, proceeding or otherwise against Neon (“**Authorized Affiliate Claim** ”), Customer must bring such Authorized Affiliate Claim directly against Neon on behalf of such Authorized Affiliate, unless Applicable Data Protection Laws require the Authorized Affiliate be a party to such claim, and all Authorized Affiliate Claims shall be considered claims made by Customer and shall be subject to any liability restrictions set forth in the Agreement, including any aggregate limitation of liability. In no event will this DPA or any party restrict or limit the rights of any data subject or of any competent supervisory authority.
     4. In the event of any conflict between this DPA and any data privacy provisions set out in any agreements between the parties relating to the Neon Services, the parties agree that the terms of this DPA shall prevail, provided that**** if and to the extent the Standard Contractual Clauses conflict with any provision of this DPA, the Standard Contractual Clauses control and take precedence. If there is any conflict between this DPA and a Business Associate Agreement entered into between the parties (“**BAA** ”), then the BAA shall prevail to the extent of any conflict solely with respect to any PHI (as defined in such BAA).
     5. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement or this DPA and to the maximum extent permitted by law, each party’s and all of its Affiliates’ liability, taken together in the aggregate, arising out of or related to this DPA (including all Annexes hereto), the SCCs or any data protection agreements in connection with the Agreement (if any), whether in contract, tort or under any other theory of liability, shall remain subject to the limitation of liability section of the Agreement and any reference in such section to the liability of a party means the aggregate liability of that party and all of its Affiliates under the Agreement and this DPA, including all Annexes hereto. Customer agrees that any regulatory penalties incurred by Neon that arise in connection with Customer’s failure to comply with its obligations under this DPA or any laws or regulations including Applicable Data Protection Laws shall reduce Neon’ liability under the Agreement as if such penalties were liabilities to Customer under the Agreement.
     6. This DPA will be governed by and construed in accordance with the governing law and jurisdiction provisions in the Agreement, unless required otherwise by Applicable Data Protection Laws.
     7. The obligations placed upon each party under this DPA and the Standard Contractual Clauses shall survive so long as Neon processes Customer Personal Data on behalf of Customer**.**

## **Annex C – Security Measures**

We currently observe the Security Measures described in this Annex C. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein will have the meanings as set forth in the Agreement. 

a) Access Control

i) Preventing Unauthorized Product Access

Outsourced processing: We host our Service on an outsourced cloud infrastructure provider, according to a shared responsibility model. Additionally, we maintain contractual relationships with vendors in order to provide the Services in accordance with our DPA. We rely on contractual agreements, privacy policies, and vendor compliance programs in order to protect data processed or stored by these vendors.

Physical and environmental security: We host our product infrastructure with multi-tenant, outsourced infrastructure providers. We do not own or maintain hardware located at the outsourced infrastructure providers’ data centers. Production servers and client-facing applications are logically and physically secured from our internal corporate information systems. The physical and environmental security controls are audited for SOC 2 Type 2.

Authentication: We implement a uniform password policy for our customer products. Customers who interact with the products via the user interface must authenticate before accessing Customer Data.

Authorization: Customer Data is stored in multi-tenant storage systems accessible to Customers via only application user interfaces and application programming interfaces. Customers are not allowed direct access to the underlying application infrastructure. The authorization model in each of our products is designed to ensure that only the appropriately assigned individuals can access relevant features, views, and customization options. Authorization to data sets is performed through validating the user’s permissions against the attributes associated with each data set.

Application Programming Interface (API) access: Public product APIs can be accessed using an API key or through Oauth authorization.

ii) Preventing Unauthorized Use

We implement industry standard access controls and detection capabilities for the internal networks that support its products.

Access controls: Network access control mechanisms are designed to prevent network traffic using unauthorized protocols from reaching the product infrastructure. The technical measures implemented differ between infrastructure providers and include Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) implementations, security group assignment, and traditional firewall rules.

Intrusion detection and prevention: We implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) solution to protect hosted customer websites and other internet-accessible applications. The WAF is designed to identify and prevent attacks against publicly available network services.

Static code analysis: Code stored in our source code repositories is checked for best practices and identifiable software flaws using automated tooling.

Penetration testing: We maintain relationships with industry-recognized penetration testing service providers for penetration testing of the Neon web application, API, and proximity and authentications flows at least annually. The intent of these penetration tests is to identify security vulnerabilities and mitigate the risk and business impact they pose to the in-scope systems.

iii) Limitations of Privilege & Authorization Requirements

Product access: A subset of our employees have access to the products and to customer data via controlled interfaces. The intent of providing access to a subset of employees is to provide effective customer support, product development and research, to troubleshoot potential problems, to detect and respond to security incidents and implement data security. Access is enabled through “just in time” (JITA) requests for access; all such requests are logged. Employees are granted access by role, and reviews of high risk privilege grants are initiated as needed. Administrative or high risk access permissions are reviewed at least annually. 

Reference checks: Where permitted by applicable law, Neon employees undergo reference checks. All Neon employees are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with company guidelines, non-disclosure requirements, and ethical standards.

b) Transmission Control

In-transit: We require HTTPS encryption (also referred to as SSL or TLS) on all login interfaces. Our HTTPS implementation uses industry standard algorithms and certificates.

At-rest: We store user passwords following policies that follow industry standard practices for security. We have implemented technologies to ensure that stored data is encrypted at rest. 

c) Input Control

Detection: We designed our infrastructure to log extensive information about the system behavior, traffic received, system authentication, and other application requests. Internal systems aggregate log data and alert appropriate employees of malicious, unintended, or anomalous activities. Our personnel, including security, operations, and support personnel, are responsive to known incidents.

Response and tracking: We maintain a record of known security incidents that includes description, dates and times of relevant activities, and incident disposition. Suspected and confirmed security incidents are investigated by security, operations, or support personnel; and appropriate resolution steps are identified and documented. For any confirmed incidents, we will take appropriate steps to minimize product and Customer damage or unauthorized disclosure. Notification to you will be in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. 

d) Availability Control

Infrastructure availability: The infrastructure providers use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure a minimum of 99.5% uptime. The providers maintain a minimum of N+1 redundancy to power, network, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) services.

Fault tolerance: Backup and replication strategies are designed to ensure redundancy and fail-over protections during a significant processing failure. Customer Data is stored in cold storage (S3 for AWS). 

Online replicas and backups: Where feasible, production databases are designed to replicate data between no less than 1 primary and 1 secondary database. All databases are backed up and maintained using at least industry standard methods.

Disaster Recovery Plans: We maintain and regularly test disaster recovery plans to help ensure availability of information following interruption to, or failure of, critical business processes.

Our products are designed to ensure redundancy and seamless failover. The server instances that support the products are also architected with a goal to prevent single points of failure. This design assists our operations in maintaining and updating the product applications and backend while limiting downtime.
