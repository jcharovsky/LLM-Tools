# AI tools for Agents

AI-powered tools for development and database management

Neon provides several ways to integrate with AI tools and agents, from natural language database control to autonomous agent frameworks. Choose the tools that fit your workflow.

## MCP integration

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for AI tools to interact with Neon databases using natural language, providing secure and contextual access to your data and infrastructure.

  * ### [Neon MCP ServerLearn about managing your Neon projects using natural language with Neon MCP Server](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server)
  * ### [Connect MCP clientsLearn how to connect MCP clients like Cursor, Claude Code, and ChatGPT to your Neon database](/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon)



## Claude Code plugin

If you're using Claude Code, install the Neon plugin to get Skills, MCP integration, and all the context rules in one package.

  * ### [Claude Code plugin for NeonIncludes Claude Code Skills for Neon, Neon MCP integration, and context rules](/docs/ai/ai-claude-code-plugin)



## AI rules

For other AI tools like Cursor, use these individual `.mdc` context rule files. Copy them to your AI tool's custom rules directory — the format is tool-agnostic and works with any AI assistant that supports context rules.

  * ### [Neon AuthAI rules for implementing authentication with Neon](/docs/ai/ai-rules-neon-auth)
  * ### [Neon DrizzleAI rules for using Drizzle ORM with Neon](/docs/ai/ai-rules-neon-drizzle)
  * ### [Neon Serverless DriverAI rules for serverless database connections](/docs/ai/ai-rules-neon-serverless)
  * ### [Neon TypeScript SDKAI rules for using the Neon TypeScript SDK](/docs/ai/ai-rules-neon-typescript-sdk)
  * ### [Neon Python SDKAI rules for using the Neon Python SDK](/docs/ai/ai-rules-neon-python-sdk)
  * ### [Neon APIAI rules for using the Neon API](/docs/ai/ai-rules-neon-api)
  * ### [Neon ToolkitAI rules for using the Neon Toolkit](/docs/ai/ai-rules-neon-toolkit)



## Build AI agents

Create autonomous agents that can manage and interact with your Neon databases programmatically. Build with our terse JavaScript client or the Neon API.
