  * Every tech choice we make is about staying lightweight and scalable. Neon fits that perfectly: we can spin up real Postgres databases in CI, in seconds, with zero hassle.

Oliver Stenbom — Co-Founder at Endform

  * Postgres fits with our architecture, and Neon made it easy. I didn’t want to deal with any overhead, Neon worked out of the box and let us stay focused.

Chris Sims — CEO and Co-Founder of Rhythmic

  * We use Neon branching in our development process to find issues, test migrations, and experiment safely.

Tal Kain — Founder and CEO at Velocity

  * Databases have always been such a pain. In Neon, everything feels easier and much safer to do.
