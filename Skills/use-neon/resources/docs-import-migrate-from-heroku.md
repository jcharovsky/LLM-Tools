# Migrate from Heroku to Neon Postgres

This guide describes how to import your data from Heroku Postgres to Neon.

#### New feature

If you are looking to migrate your database to Neon, you may want to try our new **Migration Assistant** , which can help. Read the [guide](/docs/import/migration-assistant) to learn more.

The instructions assume that you have installed the Heroku CLI, which is used to transfer data from Heroku. For installation instructions, see [The Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

  1. ## Create a Neon project and copy the connection string

     1. Navigate to the [Projects](https://console.neon.tech/app/projects) page in the Neon Console.

     2. Click **New Project**.

     3. Specify your project settings and click **Create Project**.

     4. After creating a project, you are directed to the Neon **Dashboard** , where you can click **Connect** to find your database connection details. Copy the connection string. It is required to import your data from Heroku.

The example connection string used the instructions that follow is:
            
            postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require

  2. ## Retrieve your Heroku app name and database name

     1. Log in to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) and select the project you want to import data from.
     2. Select **Overview** and copy the name of the Heroku Postgres database, which appears under **Installed add-ons**.
     3. Click **Settings** and copy your Heroku **App Name**.

#### note

You can also retrieve the Heroku Postgres database name using the following Heroku CLI command:
    
    heroku pg:links --app <app>

where `<app>` is the Heroku App Name.

For example:
    
    $ heroku pg:links --app thawing-wave-57227
    === postgresql-trapezoidal-48645

  3. ## Import your data

From your terminal, run the following Heroku CLI command:
         
         heroku pg:pull --app [app] [heroku-pg-database] [neon-connection-string]

where:

     * `[app]` is the name of the Heroku app
     * `[heroku-pg-database]` is the name of the Heroku PostgreSQL database
     * `[neon-connection-string]` is the Neon connection string

For example:
    
    $ heroku pg:pull --app thawing-wave-57227 postgresql-trapezoidal-48645 postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
    
    heroku-cli: Pulling postgresql-trapezoidal-48645 ---> postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
