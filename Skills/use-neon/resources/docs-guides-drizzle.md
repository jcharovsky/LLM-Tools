## Connect to Neon from Drizzle

To establish a basic connection from Drizzle to Neon, perform the following steps:

  1. Find your database connection string by clicking the **Connect** button on your **Project Dashboard** to open the **Connect to your database** modal. Select a branch, a user, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you. ![Connection details modal](/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fconnect%2Fconnection_details.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_BWMnjAnsz5e4vCV8rVKCfZ67QP1V) The connection string includes the user name, password, hostname, and database name.

  2. Add a `DATABASE_URL` variable to your `.env` file and set it to the Neon connection string that you copied in the previous step. We also recommend adding `?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require` to the end of the connection string to ensure a [secure connection](/docs/connect/connect-securely).

Your setting will appear similar to the following:
         
         DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require"




## Use the Neon serverless driver with Drizzle

The Neon serverless driver is a low-latency Postgres driver for JavaScript (and TypeScript) that lets you query data from serverless and edge environments. For more information about the driver, see [Neon serverless driver](/docs/serverless/serverless-driver).

To set up Drizzle with the Neon serverless driver, use the Drizzle driver adapter. This adapter allows you to choose a different database driver than Drizzle's default driver for communicating with your database.

Install the Neon serverless driver and `ws` packages:
    
    
    npm install ws @neondatabase/serverless
    npm install -D @types/ws

Update your Drizzle instance:
    
    
    import 'dotenv/config';
    import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-http';
    import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
    
    import ws from 'ws';
    neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = ws;
    
    // To work in edge environments (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, etc.), enable querying over fetch
    // neonConfig.poolQueryViaFetch = true
    
    const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
    
    export const db = drizzle({ client: sql });

You can now use Drizzle instance as you normally would with full type-safety.
