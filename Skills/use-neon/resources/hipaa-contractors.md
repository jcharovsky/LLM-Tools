# List of Neon’s Sub Contractors 

**Last updated:** 15 January 2025 

To support the delivery of our Services, Neon Inc. may engage and use subcontractors or agents to process Customer Data which includes Protected Health Information (PHI). This page provides important information about the identity, location, and role of each PHI subcontractor.

This subcontractor page is incorporated into the Business Associate Agreement entered into between Customer and Neon. 

## **Updates to this page**

Due to the nature of our global business and our ongoing efforts to delight our customers, our business needs and services providers may change from time to time. For example, we may deprecate a subcontractor to consolidate and minimize our use of providers. Similarly, we may add a provider if we believe that doing so will enhance our ability to deliver our Services.
