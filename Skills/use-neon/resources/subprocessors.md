# List of Neon’s Sub-processors

Last updated: 12 May 2025

To support the delivery of our Services, Neon Inc. may engage and use data processors with access to certain Customer Data. This page provides important information about the identity, location, and role of each Sub-processor.

This Sub-Processor page is incorporated into the [DPA](https://neon.tech/dpa) and [Terms of Service](https://neon.tech/terms-of-service) or MSA entered into between Customer and Neon (whichever shall be applicable).

## Updates to this page 

Due to the nature of our global business and our ongoing efforts to delight our customers, our business needs and services providers may change from time to time. For example, we may deprecate a service provider to consolidate and minimize our use of service providers. Similarly, we may add a service provider if we believe that doing so will enhance our ability to deliver our Services.
