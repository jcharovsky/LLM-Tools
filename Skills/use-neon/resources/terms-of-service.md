**Last updated:** 20 August 2025

Welcome to Neon! We’re delighted to have you here. While the following terms may seem like a lot of legal jargon, they play a crucial role in outlining the guidelines and regulations governing the use of Neon’s Products. It is all very formal but they set out important information and guidelines for Neon’s Products. Please take a moment to read through them. 

Using Neon’s Products is completely optional. If you’re not comfortable with any of the terms outlined below, you can choose not to register with Neon or access our Products.

Unless you and Neon agreed in the Order otherwise, all Fees are due on the first day of the month following the billing cycle and will be automatically charged to your card on or about the invoice date. For example, your usage for the month of January will be calculated and invoiced on or about February 1; and your credit card will be charged simultaneously.

You will promptly update your Account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. 

4.8**** If you fail to make any payment when due, and you have not notified Neon in writing to ar@neon.tech within seven (7) days of the payment becoming due and payable that the payment is subject to a good faith dispute, without limiting Neon’s other rights and remedies: (i) Neon may charge interest on the undisputed past due amount at the rate of 1.5% per month, calculated daily and compounded monthly or, if lower, the highest rate permitted under applicable law; (ii) if Neon requests, you shall reimburse Neon for all costs due for storage of your Projects and other Content, and other reasonable costs incurred by Neon in collecting any late payments or interest, including attorneys’ fees, court costs, and collection agency fees; and (iii) if such failure continues for seven (7) days or more, Neon may suspend your Account and your Authorized Users’ access to any portion or all of Neon Products or downgrade you to the Free Tier until such amounts are paid in full.

4.12 You will pay all applicable Taxes. When Neon has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes, the appropriate amount shall be paid by you directly to Neon. If all or any part of any payment owed to Neon under these Terms is withheld, based upon a claim that such withholding is required pursuant to the tax laws of any country or its political subdivisions and/or any tax treaty between the U.S. and any such country, such payment shall be increased by the amount necessary to result in a net payment to Neon of the amounts otherwise payable under these Terms. You will reimburse Neon any pre-approved and agreed upon costs.
