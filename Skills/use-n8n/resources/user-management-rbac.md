# Role-based access control (RBAC)#

Feature availability

RBAC is available on all plans except the Community edition. Different plans have different numbers of projects and roles. Refer to n8n's [pricing page](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for plan details.

Role types and account types

Role types and [account types](../account-types/) are different things. Every account has one type. The account can have different role types for different [projects](projects/).

RBAC is a way of managing access to workflows and [credentials](../../glossary/#credential-n8n) based on user roles and projects. You group workflows into projects, and user access depends on the user's project role. This section provides guidance on using RBAC in n8n.
