Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

  * Setting up and configuring servers and containers
  * Managing application resources and scaling
  * Securing servers and applications

n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).
