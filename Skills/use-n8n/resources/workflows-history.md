# Workflow history#

Feature availability

  * Full workflow history is available on Enterprise Cloud and Enterprise Self-hosted.
  * Versions from the last five days are available for Cloud Pro users.
  * Versions from the last 24 hours are available for registered Community users.



Use workflow history to view and restore previous versions of your workflows. 

## Understand workflow history#

n8n creates a new version when you:

  * Save your workflow.
  * Restore an old version. n8n saves the latest version before restoring.
  * Pull from a Git repository using [Source control](../../source-control-environments/). Note that n8n saves versions to the instance database, not to Git.



Workflow history and execution history

Don't confuse workflow history with the [Workflow-level executions list](../executions/single-workflow-executions/).

Executions are workflow runs. With the executions list, you can see previous runs of the current version of the workflow. You can copy previous executions into the editor to [Debug and re-run past executions](../executions/debug/) in your current workflow.

Workflow history is previous versions of the workflow: for example, a version with a different node, or different parameters set.

## View workflow history#

To view a workflow's history:

  1. Open the workflow.
  2. Select **Workflow history** ![Workflow history icon](../../_images/common-icons/workflow-history.png). n8n opens a menu showing the saved workflow versions, and a canvas with a preview of the selected version.



## Restore or copy previous versions#

You can restore a previous workflow version, or make a copy of it:

  1. On the version you want to restore or copy, select **Options** ![Options icon](../../_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png).
  2. Choose what you want to do:
     * **Restore this version** : replace your current workflow with the selected version.
     * **Clone to new workflow** : create a new workflow based on the selected version.
     * **Open version in new tab** : open a second tab displaying the selected version. Use this to compare versions.
     * **Download** : download the version as JSON.
