# Tags#

Workflow tags allow you to label your workflows. You can then filter workflows by tag.

Tags are global. This means when you create a tag, it's available to all users on your n8n instance.

## Add a tag to a workflow#

To add a tag to your workflow:

  1. In your workflow, select **\+ Add tag**.
  2. Select an existing tag, or enter a new tag name.
  3. Once you select a tag and click away from the tag modal, n8n displays the tag next to the workflow name.



You can add more than one tag.

## Filter by tag#

When browsing the workflows on your instance, you can filter by tag.

  1. On the **Workflows** page, select **Filters**.
  2. Select **Tags**.
  3. Select the tag or tags you want to filter by. n8n lists the workflows with that tag.



## Manage tags#

You can edit existing tags. Instance owners can delete tags.

  1. Select **Manage tags**. This is available from **Filters** > **Tags** on the **Workflows** page, or in the **\+ Add tag** modal in your workflow.
  2. Hover over the tag you want to change.
  3. Select **Edit** ![Add node icon](../../_images/common-icons/edit.png) to rename it, or **Delete** ![Add node icon](../../_images/common-icons/delete.png) to delete it.



Global tags

Tags are global. If you edit or delete a tag, this affects all users of your n8n instance.
