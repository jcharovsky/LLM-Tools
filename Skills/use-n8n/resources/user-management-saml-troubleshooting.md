# Troubleshooting SAML SSO#

If you get an error when testing your SAML setup, check the following:

  * Does the app you created in your IdP support SAML?
  * Did you enter the n8n redirect URL and entity ID in the correct fields in your IdP?
  * Is the metadata XML correct? Check that the metadata you copied into n8n is formatted correctly.
