# Executions#

An execution is a single run of a workflow.

## Execution modes#

There are two execution modes:

  * Manual: run workflows manually when testing. Select **Execute Workflow** to start a manual execution. You can do manual executions of active workflows, but n8n recommends keeping your workflow set to **Inactive** while developing and testing.
  * Production: a production workflow is one that runs automatically. To enable this, set the workflow to **Active**.



## Execution lists#

n8n provides two execution lists:

  * [Workflow-level executions](single-workflow-executions/): this execution list shows the executions for a single workflow.
  * [All executions](all-executions/): this list shows all executions for all your workflows.



n8n supports [adding custom data to executions](custom-executions-data/).
