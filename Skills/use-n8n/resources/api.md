# n8n public REST API#

Feature availability

The n8n API isn't available during the free trial. Please upgrade to access this feature. 

Using n8n's public [API](../glossary/#api), you can programmatically perform many of the same tasks as you can in the GUI. This section introduces n8n's REST API, including:

  * How to [authenticate](authentication/)
  * [Paginating](pagination/) results
  * Using the [built-in API playground](using-api-playground/) (self-hosted n8n only)
  * [Endpoint reference](api-reference/)



n8n provides an [n8n API node](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8n/) to access the API in your workflows.

## Learn about REST APIs#

The API documentation assumes you are familiar with REST APIs. If you're not, these resources may be helpful:

  * [KnowledgeOwl's guide to working with APIs](https://support.knowledgeowl.com/help/working-with-apis): a basic introduction, including examples of how to call REST APIs.
  * [IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is an Application Programming Interface (API)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/api): this gives a general, but technical, introduction to APIs.
  * [IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is a REST API?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/rest-apis): more detailed information about REST APIs.
  * [MDN web docs - An overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview): REST APIs work over HTTP and use HTTP verbs, or methods, to specify the action to perform.



Use the API playground

Trying out the API in the [playground](using-api-playground/) can help you understand how APIs work. If you're worried about changing live data, consider setting up a test workflow, or test n8n instance, to explore safely.
