# Set up user management on n8n Cloud#

To access user management, upgrade to version 0.195.0 or newer.

Irreversible upgrade

Once you upgrade your Cloud instance to an n8n version with user management, you can't downgrade your version.

## Step one: In-app setup#

When you set up user management for the first time, you create an owner account.

  1. Open n8n. The app displays a signup screen.
  2. Enter your details. Your password must be at least eight characters, including at least one number and one capital letter.
  3. Click **Next**. n8n logs you in with your new owner account.



## Step two: Invite users#

You can now invite other people to your n8n instance.

  1. Sign into your workspace with your owner account. (If you are in the Admin Panel open your **Workspace** from the Dashboard)
  2. Click the three dots next to your user icon at the bottom left and click **Settings**. n8n opens your **Personal settings** page.
  3. Click **Users** to go to the **Users** page.
  4. Click **Invite**.
  5. Enter the new user's email address.
  6. Click **Invite user**. n8n sends an email with a link for the new user to join.
