# Source control and environments#

Feature availability

  * Available on Enterprise.
  * You must be an n8n instance owner or instance admin to enable and configure source control.
  * Instance owners and instance admins can push changes to and pull changes from the connected repository.
  * Project admins can push changes to the connected repository. They can't pull changes from the repository.
