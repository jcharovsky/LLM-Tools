# Set the Cloud instance timezone#

You can change the timezone for your n8n instance. This affects the [Schedule Trigger](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/) and [Date & Time node](../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime/). Users can configure the timezone for individual workflows in [Workflow settings](../../workflows/settings/).

  1. On your dashboard, select **Manage**.
  2. Change the **Timezone** dropdown to the timezone you want.
