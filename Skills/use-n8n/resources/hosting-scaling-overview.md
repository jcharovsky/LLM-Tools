# Scaling n8n#

When running n8n at scale, with a large number of users, workflows, or executions, you need to change your n8n configuration to ensure good performance.

n8n can run in different [modes](../queue-mode/) depending on your needs. The `queue` mode provides the best scalability. Refer to [Queue mode](../queue-mode/) for configuration details.

You can configure data saving and pruning to improve database performance. Refer to [Execution data](../execution-data/) for details.
