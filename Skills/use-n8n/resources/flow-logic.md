# Flow logic#

n8n allows you to represent complex logic in your workflows.

This section covers:

  * [Splitting with conditionals](/flow-logic/splitting/)
  * [Merging data](/flow-logic/merging/)
  * [Looping](/flow-logic/looping/)
  * [Waiting](/flow-logic/waiting/)
  * [Sub-workflows](/flow-logic/subworkflows/)
  * [Error handling](/flow-logic/error-handling/)
  * [Execution order in multi-branch workflows](/flow-logic/execution-order/)



## Related sections#

You need some understanding of [Data](../data/) in n8n, including [Data structure](../data/data-structure/) and [Data flow within nodes](../data/data-flow-nodes/).

When building your logic, you'll use n8n's [Core nodes](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/), including:

  * Splitting: [IF](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) and [Switch](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/).
  * Merging: [Merge](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/), [Compare Datasets](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.comparedatasets/), and [Code](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).
  * Looping: [IF](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) and [Loop Over Items](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/).
  * Waiting: [Wait](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/).
  * Creating sub-workflows: [Execute Workflow](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) and [Execute Workflow Trigger](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger/).
  * Error handling: [Stop And Error](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) and [Error Trigger](../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.errortrigger/).
