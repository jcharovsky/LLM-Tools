# Data mapping#

Data mapping means referencing data from previous nodes. 

This section contains guidance on:

  * Mapping data in most scenarios: [Data mapping in the UI](data-mapping-ui/) and [Data mapping in expression](data-mapping-expressions/)
  * How to handle [item linking](data-item-linking/) when using the Code node or building your own nodes.
