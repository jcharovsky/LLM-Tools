# Credentials#

[Credentials](../glossary/#credential-n8n) are private pieces of information issued by apps and services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app or service and the n8n node.

Access the credentials UI by opening the left menu and selecting **Credentials**. n8n lists credentials you created on the **My credentials** tab. The **All credentials** tab shows all credentials you can use, included credentials shared with you by other users.

  * [Create and edit credentials](add-edit-credentials/).
  * Learn about [credential sharing](credential-sharing/).
  * Find information on setting up credentials for your services in the [credentials library](../integrations/builtin/credentials/).
