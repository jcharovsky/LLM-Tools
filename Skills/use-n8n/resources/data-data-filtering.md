# Data filtering#

Feature availability

Available on Cloud Pro and Enterprise plans.

Search and filter data in the node **INPUT** and **OUTPUT** panels. Use this to check your node's data.

To search:

  1. In a node, select **Search** ![Search icon](../../_images/common-icons/search.png) in the **INPUT** or **OUTPUT** panel.
  2. Enter your search term.



n8n filters as you type your search, displaying the objects or rows containing the term.

Filtering is purely visual: n8n doesn't change or delete data. The filter resets when you close and reopen the node.
