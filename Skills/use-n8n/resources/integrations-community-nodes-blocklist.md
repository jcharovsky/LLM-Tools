# n8n community node blocklist#

n8n maintains a blocklist of community nodes. You can't install any node on this list.

n8n may add community nodes to the blocklist for a range of reasons, including:

  * The node is intentionally malicious
  * It's low quality (low enough to be harmful)



If you are a community node creator whose node is on the blocklist, and you believe this is a mistake, contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#77571f121b1b1837194f19591e18).
