# Cloud free trial#

When you create a new n8n cloud trial, you have 14 days to try all the features of the [Pro plan](https://n8n.io/pricing/), including:

  * Global variables
  * Insights dashboard
  * Execution search
  * 5 days workflow history to rollback



The trial gives you Pro plan features with limits of 1000 executions and the same computing power as the [Starter plan](https://n8n.io/pricing/).

## Upgrade to a paid account#

You can upgrade to a paid n8n account at any time. To upgrade:

  1. Log in to your account.
  2. Click the **Upgrade** button in the upper-right corner.
  3. Select your plan and whether to pay annually or by the month.
  4. Select a payment method.



## Trial expiration#

If you don't upgrade by the end of your trial, the trial will automatically expire and your workspace will be deleted.

Download your workflows

You can [download your workflows](../download-workflows/) to reuse them later. You have 90 days to download your workflows after your free trial ends.

### Cancelling your trial#

You don't need to cancel your trial. Your trial will automatically expire at the end of the trial period and no charges will occur. All your data will be deleted soon after.
