# Choose your n8n#

This section contains information on n8n's range of platforms, pricing plans, and licenses.

## Platforms#

There are different ways to set up n8n depending on how you intend to use it:

  * [n8n Cloud](../manage-cloud/overview/): hosted solution, no need to install anything.
  * [Self-host](../hosting/): recommended method for production or customized use cases.
    * [npm](../hosting/installation/npm/)
    * [Docker](../hosting/installation/docker/)
    * [Server setup guides](../hosting/installation/server-setups/) for popular platforms
  * [Embed](../embed/): n8n Embed allows you to white label n8n and build it into your own product. Contact n8n on the [Embed website](https://n8n.io/embed/) for pricing and support.



Self-hosting knowledge prerequisites

Self-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:

  * Setting up and configuring servers and containers
  * Managing application resources and scaling
  * Securing servers and applications
  * Configuring n8n



n8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).

  * A free self-hosted community edition for self-hosted users



## Paid versions#

n8n has two paid versions:

  * n8n Cloud: choose from a range of paid plans to suit your usage and feature needs.
