# Nodes#

[Nodes](../../../glossary/#node-n8n) are the key building blocks of a [workflow](../../../glossary/#workflow-n8n). They perform a range of actions, including:

  * Starting the workflow.
  * Fetching and sending data.
  * Processing and manipulating data.



n8n provides a collection of built-in nodes, as well as the ability to create your own nodes. Refer to:

  * [Built-in integrations](../../../integrations/builtin/node-types/) to browse the node library.
  * [Community nodes](../../../integrations/community-nodes/installation/) for guidance on finding and installing community-created nodes.
  * [Creating nodes](../../../integrations/creating-nodes/overview/) to start building your own nodes.



## Add a node to your workflow#

### Add a node to an empty workflow#

  1. Select **Add first step**. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse [trigger nodes](../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n).
  2. Select the trigger you want to use.

Choose the correct app event

If you select **On App Event** , n8n shows a list of all the supported services. Use this list to browse n8n's integrations and trigger a workflow in response to an event in your chosen service. Not all integrations have triggers. To see which ones you can use as a trigger, select the node. If a trigger is available, you'll see it at the top of the available operations list.

For example, this is the trigger for Asana:

### Add a node to an existing workflow#

Select the **Add node** ![Add node icon](../../../_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) connector. n8n opens the nodes panel, where you can search or browse all nodes.

## Node operations: Triggers and Actions#

When you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data.

There are two types of operation:

  * Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon ![Trigger icon](../../../_images/common-icons/trigger.png).
  * Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected.



## Node controls#

To view node controls, hover over the node on the canvas:

  * **Execute step** ![Execute step icon](../../../_images/common-icons/play-node.png): Run the node.
  * **Deactivate** ![Deactivate node icon](../../../_images/common-icons/power-off.png): Deactivate the node.
  * **Delete** ![Delete node icon](../../../_images/common-icons/delete-node.png): Delete the node.
  * **Node context menu** ![Node context menu icon](../../../_images/common-icons/node-context-menu.png): Select node actions. Available actions:
    * Open node
    * Execute step
    * Rename node
    * Deactivate node
    * Pin node
    * Copy node
    * Duplicate node
    * Tidy up workflow
    * Convert node to sub-workflow
    * Select all
    * Clear selection
    * Delete node



## Node settings#

The node settings under the **Settings** tab allow you to control node behaviors and add node notes.

When active or set, they do the following:

  * **Always Output Data** : The node returns an empty item even if the node returns no data during execution. Be careful setting this on IF nodes, as it could cause an infinite loop.
  * **Execute Once** : The node executes once, with data from the first item it receives. It doesn't process any extra items.
  * **Retry On Fail** : When an execution fails, the node reruns until it succeeds. 
  * **On Error** : 
    * **Stop Workflow** : Halts the entire workflow when an error occurs, preventing further node execution.
    * **Continue** : Proceeds to the next node despite the error, using the last valid data.
    * **Continue (using error output)** : Continues workflow execution, passing error information to the next node for potential handling.



You can document your workflow using node notes:

  * **Notes** : Note to save with the node.
  * **Display note in flow** : If active, n8n displays the note in the workflow as a subtitle.
