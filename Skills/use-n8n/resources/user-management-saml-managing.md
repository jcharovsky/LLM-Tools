# Manage users with SAML#

Feature availability

  * Available on Enterprise plans.
  * You need to be an instance owner or admin to enable and configure SAML.



There are some user management tasks that are affected by SAML.

## Exempt users from SAML#

You can allow users to log in without using SAML. To do this:

  1. Go to **Settings** > **Users**.
  2. Select the menu icon by the user you want to exempt from SAML.
  3. Select **Allow Manual Login**.



## Deleting users#

If you remove a user from your IdP, they remain logged in to n8n. You need to manually remove them from n8n as well. Refer to [Manage users](../../manage-users/) for guidance on deleting users.
