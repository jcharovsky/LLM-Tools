At TanStack, our philosophy is simple: we build for the open web, open standards, and the freedom to compose, deploy, and innovate however you see fit.

## Independently Owned, Unbiased by Design

TanStack LLC is currently **100% privately owned** by its founder with no external investors, no controlling interests, and no hidden agendas. It's currently funded by media and marketing partnerships with companies that share our core values: **the open web, open standards, and the freedom to compose and deploy anything you want, anywhere you please.**

## A Sustainable Future

TanStack is a lean, focused team: a full-time founder, several prominent and well-sponsored maintainers, contractors and contributors, and a thriving community of users who share our core values.

Instead of chasing growth at all costs, **we focus on sustainable growth that prioritizes developer experience, community needs, and long-term value creation.** Our goal is to build lasting tools that genuinely improve how developers work, not to hit arbitrary metrics or satisfy external investor demands.

That means:

  * No pressure to chase profits at the cost of developer experience.
  * No corporate influence dictating our technical direction.
  * A singular focus on **building tools that make the web better for users and developers**



## Technology-Agnostic by Default

We believe in **framework-agnostic, platform-agnostic, and future-proof tooling** that puts developers first:

  * TanStack libraries are built on framework and platform-agnostic primitives. When our libraries build on other tools, like TanStack Start builds on Vite, we ensure that these tools uphold these same values of openness and flexibility.
  * **TanStack Libraries** either already support or will support all major (and some minor!) frameworks and deployment environments—no exceptions.
  * **If there's any technology we're aligned with, it's TypeScript** —or more broadly, "typed JavaScript", whatever that evolves into as time goes on.



## Open Partners

Every partner we work with also actively upholds our values. They acknowledge that TanStack's OSS is a platform for developers, not a product to be leveraged:

  * No partner can dictate or influence TanStack's core technology in a way that biases it toward their platform.
  * Our libraries are built to serve **developers first** , and when appropriate, integrate with high quality external services that enhance the developer experience.
  * Companies that support us do so first and foremost because they believe in what we're building and want to see it succeed for many years to come.



At the end of the day, **TanStack isn't just a set of libraries—it's a commitment to building the web _on your terms_ , without compromise.** All we need is enough to keep improving tools that we believe actually make the web a better place.

**\- Tanner Linsley**  
Founder, TanStack LLC
